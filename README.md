# Gulp Zero Static
A set of instructions for the gulp collector, for rapid development (locally) with automatic page reloading.

Designed to generate base files for layout :
- `pug -> html`;
- `stylus -> css`.

To start rapid development, a collection of browser style collection has been added: Normalize.css and a personal work set with flexbox.

## First start
Need global install `gulp` package.  
Install via Yarn:
```bash
$ yarn global add gulp --prefix /usr/local
```
...or NPM:
```
$ npm i -g gulp
```
Run serve from repository folder
```bash
$ gulp
```
